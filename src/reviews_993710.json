Seth Gordon fails to strike the necessary balance between action, humor, and emotion to stand out in the genre, delivering a highly forgettable, formulaic piece.\r\n\r\nCameron Diaz's return is squandered in a movie that fails to showcase her talent or that of the star-studded cast. The film not only struggles to justify its runtime but also leaves viewers feeling like having watched something generic and devoid of identity, where only the stunt department earns praise.\r\n\r\nFor the start of a new cinematic year, this is a misstep I sincerely hope doesn't set the tone for what's to come.\"\r\n\r\nRating: D-",
